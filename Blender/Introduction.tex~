For a system defined with many possible configurations defined through a model Hamiltonian, calculated from model potentials, or through first principles methods it may be desirable to calculate the density of energy states.  This can be a very difficult problem and there are methods to achieve this such as the Wang and Landau algorithm.  In this paper a method is proposed that combines the use of random sets along with the importance sampling method of the Wang and Landau algorithm. This algorithm is referred to as the ``B$_{L}$ENDER" (B$_{L}$end Each New Density Each Round) algorithm. The name ``B$_{L}$ENDER" functions as an acronym and adjective which comes in part because how it blends the ideas of a random set and the Wang and Landau method, and also due to the nature of the algorithm iteratively blending histograms to produced a converged density of states.
