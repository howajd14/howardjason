	journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
	abstract = {We demonstrate the feasibility of performing sufficient configurational sampling of disordered oxides directly from first-principles without resorting to the use of fitted models such as cluster expansion. This is achieved by harnessing the power of modern-day cluster supercomputers using the replica exchange Monte Carlo method coupled directly with structural relaxation and energy calculation performed by density functional codes. The idea is applied successfully to the calculation of the temperature-dependence of the degree of inversion in the cation sublattice of MgAl2O4 spinel oxide. The possibility of bypassing fitting models will lead to investigation of disordered systems where cluster expansion is known to perform badly, for example, systems with large lattice deformation due to defects, or systems where long-range interactions dominate such as electrochemical interfaces.}

We will discuss: (a) partial occupancies within the framework of the linear tetrahedron method and the finite temperature density-functional theory, (b) iterative methods for the diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian and a discussion of an efficient iterative method based on the ideas of Pulay's residual minimization, which is close to an order Natoms2 scaling even for relatively large systems, (c) efficient Broyden-like and Pulay-like mixing methods for the charge density including a new special ‘preconditioning’ optimized for a plane-wave basis set, (d) conjugate gradient methods for minimizing the electronic free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom simultaneously. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable."

The lattice structure, microstructure and transport properties were studied and compared with those of the LLTO ceramics prepared via conventional sintering method. Though the sintering methods both led to pure perovskite LLTO phase, they produced different crystallites. The LLTO prepared via microwave technique presented cubic perovskite-type crystallite, while the LLTO via conventional method offered tetragonal crystallite. In addition, the microwave sintering resulted in the formation of better-grained LLTO ceramics but lower conductivity than the conventional one did. This was explained by considering the different microstructures and conduction mechanisms of lithium ions in the two cases."

abstract  ="Perovskite-type lanthanum lithium titanate (LLTO) is attracting extensive interest because of its high intrinsic ionic conductivity. The material exhibits a complex microstructure with domains of various sizes and orientations that vary with the lithium content. Based on a systematic examination of both Li-poor and Li-rich LLTO compounds using state-of-the-art scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM){,} we reveal the structures and composition of the domain boundaries (DBs) and consider their effect on Li-ion mobility and ionic conductivity{,} in the process positing the origin of the microstructural variations. DBs in this material are shown to consist essentially of two types: frequently occurring 90° rotation DBs and a much less common antiphase-type boundary. It is found that the 90° DBs are coherent interfaces consisting of interconnected steps that share La sites{,} with occupancies of La sites higher than in the domain interiors. The origin of microstructural variations in the two compounds is associated with different degrees of lattice mismatch strain at DBs in Li-poor and Li-rich materials. The lattice strain and associated O vacancies{,} as well as the high La occupancies{,} at DBs are expected to result in lower interdomain Li-ion mobility{,} which will have a deleterious effect on the overall ion conductivity."}

abstract = "The solid solution La2/3−xLi3xTiO3 (0.03<x<0.167) has been investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), impedance spectroscopy (IS) and 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. In these samples, a change of symmetry from tetragonal to orthorhombic is observed when the lithium content is decreased below x=0.06. Structural modifications produced are mainly due to cation vacancies ordering along the c-axis, which disappear gradually when the Li content increases. Two Li signals with different quadrupole constants are detected in 7Li NMR spectra of orthorhombic/tetragonal perovskites, which have been associated with two crystallographic sites. In La0.5Li0.5TiO3 perovskite, prepared by quenching from 1300°C into liquid nitrogen, an important mobility for Li was detected in 7Li NMR spectra. In perovskites analysed, the dependence of electrical conductivity on Li content departs from that expected on the basis of a random distribution of La and Li in A sites. Dc conductivity increases quickly with the Li content in orthorhombic samples, but changes much more smoothly in tetragonal ones, where vacancies distribution becomes progressively disordered. In all perovskites analysed, the dependence of dc-conductivity with temperature displays a non-Arrhenius behaviour, with activation energies of 0.39±0.02 and 0.29±0.02 eV in 160–250 and 250–360 K temperature ranges respectively."

The atomistic structure of 90° domain boundaries in LLTO was determined from aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy images. At 90° domain boundaries, each perovskite unit of one domain is connected by an La-rich layer to units of the neighboring domain. First-principles calculations of a model domain boundary show that Li migration through the La layer has a very high activation energy, Ea, of 3.58 eV, indicating that La layers serve to block Li migration. However, if La vacancies are present within La layers, the migration energy decreases significantly to 0.58 eV, a value more in line with experimental observation. The results show that Li conduction in LLTO is strongly influenced by 90° domain boundaries. The activation energy in a single crystal (Ea = 0.19 eV) is much lower, suggesting that if 90° domain boundaries could be eliminated, an increase in conductivity of approximately three orders of magnitude compared with conventional LLTO could be achieved."
